WHERE IS THE BUTTON!?!?

Cupid draw back your bow, and let your arrow flow. 
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me!

## User Experience

### User Stories

#### Site-goals 
* Provide a system to allow users to see a countdown based on their planned meeting date and their geo-location.
* Allow users to create a profile to enter relationship details.
* Responsive application, based on Hackathon judging criteria, where a CSS framework is used and Valentine's day is the theme .

#### Agile Methodology
The project was developed by using agile methodologies. The development cycle was divided into short sprints, where code was delivered in small chunks for flexibility and good coding practice.
Furthermore, the branch system and forking was used to simulate a real-world developer team environment.

The Kanban board was created to keep track of project progression and issues assessment. Issues were given acceptance criteria and were split into tasks if feasible.


## The Scope Plane
* Responsive design - website should support devices from 320px up
* Hamburger menu for mobile devices
* Interactive World Map with minimally invasive information details about couples relationships
* Shopping cart for users that want to buy gifts
